# A browser-based chess app in Gleam/Lustre

All the actual chess logic courtesy of [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js), which I've shamelessly copied into `./src/` for convenience.

The main purpose of this (besides learning a bit about [Lustre](https://hexdocs.pm/lustre/)) is to be able to play against my own entry in [the Gleam Chess Tournament](https://github.com/isaacharrisholt/gleam-chess-tournament).
